## Introduction

In this repository you will be able to find all project files of the Autonomous Mobile Robot built using the Webots Simulation Platform. The robot is able to perform various tasks such as line following with pid control, wall following, picking a box, climbing a ramp, counting pillars and avoiding obstacles on its' way. You can simulate the robot by yourself.

### Dependencies
* [`Webots`](https://cyberbotics.com/) : OPEN SOURCE ROBOT SIMULATOR
